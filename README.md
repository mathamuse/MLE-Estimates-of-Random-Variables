# MLE-Estimators-for-Simulations-of-Random-Variables
This is a set of Python Codes related to a basic data science Probability Course at a masters level. We study Estimators , in particular, MLE Estimators of various standard probability distributions.

The theory for Maximum Likelihood Estimators can be found briefly here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation

We study the various MLE Estimators for Standard Distributions. 
We do this by:
STEP 1 : Creating a data frame by generating data according to the probability distribution. 
STEP 2 : Then we apply the MLE Estimators to make an estimate of the parameter in consideration.
STEP 3 : (optional) We estimate percentage error by checking against our known parameter. We can also visualize the data with graphs.

Instructors can use the data generated in STEP 1 to create exercises for students to test their code. 
Instructors can use the complete code to check the working of students code by standardizing estimation.
